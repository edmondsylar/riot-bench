## 📦 What We Built

### 1. BeamTaskDoFn Adapter (215 lines)
**Purpose**: Wrap any ITask as an Apache Beam DoFn

**Key Features**:
- DoFn lifecycle management (setup → process → teardown)
- Per-worker task instantiation (one task per worker)
- Automatic metrics collection (Beam counters)
- None filtering for windowed tasks
- Error sentinel filtering (float('-inf'))
- Thread-safe initialization

**Architecture**:
```python
class BeamTaskDoFn(beam.DoFn):
    def __init__(self, task_name, config):
        # Validate task registered, store config
        
    def setup(self):
        # Create task instance (once per worker)
        
    def process(self, element):
        # Execute task, filter None/errors, yield results
        
    def teardown(self):
        # Cleanup resources
```

**Test Coverage**: 88% (15 tests)
- Creation tests (3)
- Lifecycle tests (3)
- Execution tests (4)
- Integration tests (4)
- Display tests (1)

### 2. BeamRunner Pipeline Builder (287 lines)
**Purpose**: High-level pipeline construction and execution

**Key Features**:
- File-based I/O (ReadFromText → Task → WriteToText)
- Batch processing (multiple files)
- Stream processing (in-memory elements)
- DirectRunner for local execution
- DataflowRunner factory for cloud execution
- Metrics collection and reporting

**Architecture**:
```python
class BeamRunner:
    def run_file(input, output, skip_header):
        # Read → Process → Write pipeline
        
    def run_batch(inputs, output_dir):
        # Process multiple files
        
    def run_stream(elements):
        # In-memory processing
        
    @staticmethod
    def create_dataflow_runner(...):
        # Google Cloud Dataflow configuration
```

**Test Coverage**: 93% (18 tests)
- Creation tests (3)
- File processing tests (6)
- Batch processing tests (3)
- Stream processing tests (2)
- Dataflow factory test (1)
- Metrics tests (3)

### 4. CLI Integration (310 lines)
**Commands**: `pyriotbench beam run-file` and `pyriotbench beam run-batch`

#### run-file Command
```bash
# Basic usage
pyriotbench beam run-file kalman_filter input.txt -o output.txt

# With configuration
pyriotbench beam run-file noop data.csv -o result.txt -c config.yaml

# Skip header line
pyriotbench beam run-file senml_parse data.csv -o parsed.txt --skip-header

# Cloud execution (Dataflow)
pyriotbench beam run-file kalman gs://bucket/input.txt -o gs://bucket/output.txt \
  --runner DataflowRunner \
  --project my-project \
  --region us-central1 \
  --temp-location gs://bucket/temp \
  --staging-location gs://bucket/staging
```

**Features**:
- Task name validation
- Input file validation
- Configuration file support (YAML/properties)
- DirectRunner (default) / DataflowRunner selection
- Progress reporting
- Metrics display (elements, success rate, throughput)

#### run-batch Command
```bash
# Process multiple files
pyriotbench beam run-batch noop file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt -o output/

# Glob patterns (via shell expansion)
pyriotbench beam run-batch kalman_filter *.txt -o results/

# With configuration
pyriotbench beam run-batch bloom_filter_check *.csv -o output/ -c bloom.yaml
```

**Features**:
- Multiple file processing
- Individual output files (input_output.txt naming)
- Aggregate metrics (total elements, average throughput)
- Error handling (continue on failure)
- Batch summary report

## 🏆 Key Achievements

### 1. Zero Task Modifications Required
**Proven**: Tasks run on Beam **without any code changes**
- ✅ noop task
- ✅ kalman_filter (stateful)
- ✅ block_window_average (windowed)
- ✅ bloom_filter_check
- ✅ decision_tree_classify

**Architecture Win**: ITask protocol + adapter pattern = perfect portability!

### 2. Full Lifecycle Support
**DoFn Lifecycle**:
- `__init__`: Configuration validation
- `setup()`: Per-worker task creation (thread-safe)
- `process()`: Element-by-element execution
- `teardown()`: Resource cleanup

**Metrics Collection**:
- `success_counter`: Beam counter (successful executions)
- `error_counter`: Beam counter (failed executions)
- `execution_time_dist`: Beam distribution (timing stats)

### 3. Filtering Support
**None Filtering**: Windowed tasks emit None when window incomplete
- Block window average returns None until window full
- DoFn filters None results automatically
- Only full window averages written to output

**Error Filtering**: Tasks return float('-inf') on errors
- Bloom filter returns -inf on setup failures
- DoFn filters error sentinels
- Errors counted but not written to output

### 4. Cloud-Ready
**DirectRunner**: Local development and testing
- Single machine execution
- Fast iteration
- No cloud account needed

**DataflowRunner**: Production-scale processing
- Google Cloud Dataflow integration
- Horizontal scaling (thousands of workers)
- GCS input/output support
- Factory method for easy configuration

## 🔧 Implementation Details

### Bug Fixes
**Issue #1: Metrics Collection**
- **Problem**: BeamRunner looking for files with `-00000-of-00001` suffix
- **Root Cause**: When using `shard_name_template=''` and `num_shards=1`, Beam writes directly to filename without suffix
- **Fix**: Updated `_collect_metrics()` to check actual output file
- **Result**: 8 failing tests → 18 passing tests (100%)

**Issue #2: Task Registration**
- **Problem**: Example script couldn't find tasks (empty registry)
- **Root Cause**: Example didn't import task modules, so `@register_task` decorators never executed
- **Fix**: Added `import pyriotbench.tasks` at top of examples and test conftest.py
- **Result**: All 5 examples working perfectly

**Issue #3: Noop Task Missing**
- **Problem**: `pyriotbench.tasks` import didn't include noop
- **Root Cause**: noop.py in root tasks/ directory, not in submodule
- **Fix**: Added explicit noop import to tasks/__init__.py
- **Result**: All tasks now registered correctly

### Design Patterns
**Adapter Pattern**: BeamTaskDoFn wraps ITask
- Translates ITask interface to Beam DoFn interface
- Handles lifecycle differences
- Manages metrics translation

**Template Method**: BaseTask provides timing
- Automatic execution timing (microsecond precision)
- Success/error tracking
- Consistent behavior across platforms

**Factory Pattern**: BeamRunner.create_dataflow_runner()
- Encapsulates complex Dataflow configuration
- Simplifies cloud execution setup
- Type-safe parameter validation

## 📝 Code Examples

### Example 1: Simple Pipeline
```python
import apache_beam as beam
import pyriotbench.tasks  # Trigger registration

from pyriotbench.platforms.beam.adapter import BeamTaskDoFn

# Create pipeline
with beam.Pipeline() as pipeline:
    results = (
        pipeline
        | 'Read' >> beam.io.ReadFromText('sensor_data.txt')
        | 'Kalman Filter' >> beam.ParDo(BeamTaskDoFn(
            'kalman_filter',
            {'STATISTICS.KALMAN_FILTER.PROCESS_NOISE': 0.01}
        ))
        | 'Write' >> beam.io.WriteToText('filtered.txt')
    )
```

### Example 2: Using BeamRunner
```python
from pyriotbench.platforms.beam.runner import BeamRunner

# Create runner
runner = BeamRunner('kalman_filter', {
    'STATISTICS.KALMAN_FILTER.PROCESS_NOISE': 0.01,
    'STATISTICS.KALMAN_FILTER.MEASUREMENT_NOISE': 0.1,
})

# Run pipeline
metrics = runner.run_file('input.txt', 'output.txt')

print(f"Processed: {metrics['elements_read']} → {metrics['elements_written']}")
print(f"Success rate: {metrics['success_rate']:.1%}")
print(f"Throughput: {metrics['throughput_per_s']:.1f} records/s")
```

### Example 3: CLI Usage
```bash
# List available tasks
pyriotbench list-tasks

# Run with Beam
pyriotbench beam run-file kalman_filter sensor.txt -o filtered.txt

# Batch processing
pyriotbench beam run-batch noop *.txt -o output/

# With configuration
pyriotbench beam run-file kalman sensor.txt -o filtered.txt -c config.yaml
```

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Adapter Pattern**: Perfect fit for platform integration
2. **DoFn Lifecycle**: Natural mapping to task setup/execute/teardown
3. **Test-First Approach**: Caught bugs early (metrics collection, task registration)
4. **Progressive Implementation**: Adapter → Runner → Examples → CLI
5. **Comprehensive Testing**: 33 tests gave us confidence in the implementation

### Challenges Overcome
1. **Beam File Naming**: Understanding shard_name_template behavior
2. **Task Registration**: Import order matters for decorator execution
3. **Metrics Collection**: Beam's async execution required careful timing
4. **None Handling**: Windowed tasks need special filtering support

### Architecture Validation
✅ **Portability Proven**: Same tasks run on Beam without modifications  
✅ **Lifecycle Works**: setup/process/teardown maps correctly  
✅ **Metrics Integrate**: Beam counters work with our metrics system  
✅ **Filtering Works**: None and error sentinel filtering functional  
✅ **Stateful Tasks Work**: Kalman filter maintains state per worker  
✅ **Windowed Tasks Work**: Block window average filters correctly

## 📈 Performance Insights

### DirectRunner (Local)
**Throughput**: ~1-10 records/second (single machine, development mode)
- Suitable for testing and small datasets
- No cluster overhead
- Immediate feedback

### Expected Dataflow Performance
**Throughput**: ~1,000-100,000+ records/second (production, scaled)
- Horizontal scaling (auto-scaling workers)
- Distributed execution across GCP
- Production-ready reliability

### Bottlenecks Identified
1. **Task Complexity**: Kalman filter slower than noop (expected)
2. **I/O**: File reading/writing dominates simple tasks
3. **Beam Overhead**: Pipeline initialization takes ~3 seconds
4. **Windowing**: Partial windows filtered, reducing throughput

**Optimization Opportunities**:
- Batch elements before task execution
- Use Beam windowing instead of stateful tasks
- Minimize DoFn state (use class variables)
- Tune parallelism settings
